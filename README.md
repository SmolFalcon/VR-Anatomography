## User Interface
The user can see a label of the anatomical component they are hovering with each controller, and access to 4 buttons:
- Reattach: When pressed, the components float back to their original place after being manipulated
- Skeleton: Toggles visibility of the skeletal system
- Muscles: Toggles visibility of muscles
- Culling: Shows a user-controllable culling sphere to only display a portion of the model
